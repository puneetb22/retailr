App Overview:
Build a python tk inter and SQLite based, offline-first Point of Sale (POS) system for an Agritech products shop in Maharashtra, designed to run locally on a laptop without internet, hosting, or deployment costs. The POS will manage inventory, sales, billing, and reporting — with features tailored for agricultural inputs like fertilizers and pesticides.

It should be simple enough for rural shopkeepers, while also offering advanced controls and developer-access features for maintainability.
